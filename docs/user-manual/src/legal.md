# Legal and Licensing

## Open Source Compliance

Veecle OS is built using various open-source libraries and dependencies.
If you distribute applications built with Veecle OS, you may need to include license attribution for the third-party libraries Veecle OS uses.

The specific requirements depend on your distribution method and the licenses involved.
Generally, including the attribution information with your distributed software satisfies these obligations.

Refer to the [Third-Party Notices](./third-party-notices.md) section for the complete list of dependencies and their licenses.
Note that this list includes licenses for all components of Veecle OS; in a typical deployment only a small subset of these dependencies would actually be used.
