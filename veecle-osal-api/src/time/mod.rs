//! Abstractions for time-based operations.
//!
//! The main purpose of this module is to provide the definition of [`TimeAbstraction`], the trait that has to be
//! implemented to interact with the underlying operating system when performing time-based operations.
//! In order to keep the time abstractions as decoupled as possible from the running environment, this module provides
//! its own [`Instant`] and [`Duration`] types.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Runtime actors using time-based operations should rely on the [`TimeAbstraction`] trait, and never use specific
//! implementations. It is during the runtime's setup that the concrete implementation for the targeted environment has
//! to be specified.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use core::convert::Infallible;

//! use veecle_osal_api::time::{Duration, TimeAbstraction};
//! use veecle_osal_std::time::Time;
//! use veecle_os_runtime::{Reader, Storable, Writer};
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Default, Storable)]
//! pub struct Tick {
//!     since_epoch: Duration,
//! }
//!
//! #[veecle_os_runtime::actor]
//! async fn tick_writer<T>(mut writer: Writer<'_, Tick>) -> Infallible
//! where
//!     T: TimeAbstraction,
//! {
//!     let epoch = T::now();
//!
//!     loop {
//!         let _ = T::sleep_until(T::now() + Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
//!         writer
//!             .write(Tick {
//!                 since_epoch: T::now()
//!                     .duration_since(epoch)
//!                     .expect("now should be later than epoch"),
